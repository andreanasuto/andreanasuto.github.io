The task for CLI Project was to scrape information from any webpage I liked: weather forecasting page, news page, anything sport related. Based on that information I created my own program. I picked the Transfermkt website (https://www.transfermarkt.com/), I scraped updated information on my favorite soccer league (or football, it depends on which side of the ocean you live!) and played around with that information. I created a program that could provide a user with detailed information about a specific team in the league I've selected: Serie A, the Italian soccer league.

Transfermarkt is a great German website for soccer. It has a lot of data including several detailed financial values.  I've used in the past to make some fun computations and analysis on European football. 

My program shows first and foremost the current standings of the league, after that, it is possible to select a team based on their ranking and see information as:

(I've picked my favourite team as an example: Inter Milan)

- "Inter is currently valued $635.44mn"
Total team market value in millions of $

- "Inter players average age is 28,8"
The average age of the team

- "They play at Stadio San Siro - Giuseppe Meazza"
This line shows the stadium where they play
