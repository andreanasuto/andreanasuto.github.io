failed hack
```

I've always tried to hack the hackers. I've failed, so I've started learning coding. Let me explain.

I was interested in building technological tools since I was 19 y/o. 
I have graduated in Economics and Finance with no coding skills apart from some statistical tools and a elective short course in SQL. Around that age, when I was just beginning my college years in Italy, I started this project with some of my colleagues: a web application to find good deals to drink better than I was doing, to eat better than I would have liked or in other words, to have more impact that I was having. This was way before the 'startup overheating', in fact we didn't even call it 'a startup'. It was hard more than fun but the impact on me was enormous.
That experience, creating something fromscratch, owning the results, changed what I was expecting from myself and what kind of impact I could have on people around me.

It was also my first trial of hacking the hackers. The hackers were the coders, the engineers, the technical people. Me, the 'flully man', 'the (partially) doer', 'a strategist with no army'. Obvisiouly, I disagreed, not only because I thought I was having a serious (and yet difficult to measure) impact, but because I thought that 90% things that I could have done in the future we reachable without learning how to code. Solution? Learning how to assembly different not technical tools to create
digital products. I was trying to beat the coders, skipping the coding.

Technically, this idea is almost feasable. What I didn't expect it was my willingness to explore more and more direction in web development/design. I've always tried to use my design, research and storytelling skills to create something digitally  complex but the challenge started to become more and more difficult as my ideas and needs become complex.

So, here I am, learning coding the hard way.
